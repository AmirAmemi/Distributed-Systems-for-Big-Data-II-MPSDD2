# 🖥️ Distributed Systems for Big Data II (MPSDD2)

This repository contains projects and assignments from the **Distributed Systems for Big Data II** course, which focuses on **distributed computing** techniques and their applications to **big data processing**. The projects explore various distributed frameworks such as **Hadoop**, **Spark**, and other technologies that facilitate the processing of large datasets across multiple nodes in a system.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Distributed Systems for Big Data II** course focuses on the following key areas of big data and distributed systems:

- **Big Data Frameworks**: Using **Hadoop** and **Spark** to process large datasets in a distributed fashion.
- **MapReduce**: Implementing MapReduce algorithms to process large volumes of data across a distributed system.
- **Data Parallelism**: Understanding how data can be distributed and processed in parallel to improve scalability and efficiency.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implementing and understanding fault tolerance mechanisms in distributed environments.
- **Real-time Processing**: Working with **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Flink** for real-time stream processing.
  
The repository contains several projects demonstrating the implementation of these concepts and their practical applications.
